# Daily Commits Bot

This repository automatically performs a **daily commit** using **GitHub Actions**.
It helps maintain a continuous GitHub contribution streak and serves as a simple time log of activity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

* A scheduled workflow runs **once a day** (using a cron job on GitHub Actions).
* It appends the current UTC date and time to `daily-log.txt`.
* Then, it commits and pushes the change automatically.
* The process requires **no local machine** ‚Äî it runs entirely in the cloud.
